# Introduction

TalkLift uses Webhooks and REST API to communicate between systems. From your [TalkLift Account](https://app.talklift.com) you can configure your application backend to receive various EVENTS sent when users:

  - Reaches a [SLOT](/#webhook-on-slot-filling)
  - Completes a [MODULE](/#webhook-when-user-completes-module)


# How to Setup Webhook

Login to your [account](https://app.talklift.com) and select the project you would like to work with.

Navigate to the **integrations** setting. Under the Webhook section, set your endpoint url and basic auth details if available.

![Webhook Setup Form](images/webhook-setting-form.png)

# Authentication

> TalkLift API uses token authentication. To authenticate your API, send your request with the Authorization header.

```shell
curl "https://app.talklift.com/api/v1/api-resource/" 
  -H 'Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b'
```

> Make sure to replace `9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b` with your API Token.

You can access your API Token from your account under your [profile's](https://app.talklift.com/profile/#api-token]) API section.

`Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b</code> with your personal API token.

# Webhooks Workflow

## How it works

![Webhooks Summary Diagram](images/talklift-webhook-flow.png)

## Webhook On Slot Filling

Slots are used to collect users information e.g KYC details. Think of slots just like forms that 
the users need to fill as part of an application to accomplish the set goals. During the slot filling 
process, you might want to validate users information through an external endpoint and revert to the users based on your findings.

### Slot filling use cases examples

  - Validating user membership number through a third party API
  - Check if user provided input is valid e.g supported delivery location for e-commerce delivery
  - Save provided information before the user completes the rest of the questions
  - Authenticate the user through a third party OTP

### How to set a Slot Filling Webhook

From your module, click *Ask for customer information* as shown in the figure below. The collected information are collected through what we call slots. Think of them as form fields with different types e.g email, number etc. Users will be asked to provide the information and in the order set. 

After setting your slot, click on the edit button to open the advance option where you can set the webhook request. Set 'Validate with Webhook' to trigger a webhook event when the user fills the slot.

## Webhook When User Completes Module

This webhook request is fired when the user chats with your bot and completes the module. Remember, a module can contain general responses and/or slots (KYC request). An event is fired when the user provides a final response.
